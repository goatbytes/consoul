  "title": "Conversation UI not reconstructed from database",
  "description": "When reloading a conversation from the database, the UI does not match the original:\n- Tool calls are not displayed with proper formatting\n- Attachments have no UI representation\n- Images referenced in prompts that get converted are not shown\n- The system message showing tool execution is displayed as raw text\n\nThis is a significant UX issue as users lose context when revisiting saved conversations.\n\nRoot cause: The database schema stores raw message content but not the UI component metadata needed to reconstruct the visual representation.\n\nPotential solutions:\n1. Extend database schema to store UI component metadata\n2. Add message type field to distinguish tool calls, system messages, attachments\n3. Create parsers to reconstruct UI components from stored message content",
