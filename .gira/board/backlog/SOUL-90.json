  "title": "Research rich file operations for line-based editing",
  "description": "Research and design line-based file editing capabilities inspired by cursor-agent.\n\nCurrent state:\n- Consoul uses basic file operations through bash_execute tool\n- No native file manipulation tools in the SDK\n\nProposed features from cursor-agent:\n- Line-based editing with JSON format: {\"1-5\": \"new content\", \"10-12\": \"more content\"}\n- Complete file replacement option\n- Read file with line range control\n- Better validation and error handling\n\nResearch tasks:\n1. Review cursor-agent's file_tools.py implementation\n2. Analyze how line-based editing improves AI coding workflows\n3. Design API that integrates with Consoul's tool system\n4. Consider security implications and permission requirements\n5. Evaluate if this should be SDK tools or TUI-specific features\n6. Plan integration with existing bash_execute tool\n\nSuccess criteria:\n- Document technical approach\n- Create API design proposal\n- Identify security considerations\n- Estimate implementation effort\n\nReferences:\n- cursor-agent file_tools.py\n- Consoul tool system: src/consoul/ai/tools/",
