  "description": "Copied from shell session:\n\n```bash\n> consoul tui\n_GatheringFuture exception was never retrieved\nfuture: <_GatheringFuture finished exception=RuntimeError('cannot reuse already awaited coroutine')>\nRuntimeError: cannot reuse already awaited coroutine\n_GatheringFuture exception was never retrieved\nfuture: <_GatheringFuture finished exception=RuntimeError('cannot reuse already awaited coroutine')>\nRuntimeError: cannot reuse already awaited coroutine\n```\n\nnotes: During the `consoul tui` session, I chatted with an ollama model and then switched to a claude/anthropic model. The LLMs called multiple tools. I noticed that during a tool call the TUI would freeze. The main issue in this ticket is the output though.",
