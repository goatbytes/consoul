      "content": "Performance optimization work completed:\n\n✅ Completed Items:\n- GC settings optimized (gc_mode, gc_interval_seconds, gc_generation in TuiConfig)\n- Widget rendering optimized (stream_buffer_size, stream_debounce_ms)\n- Scroll performance optimized (enable_virtualization for large lists)\n- Launch time target exceeded: 340ms achieved (target was <500ms)\n- Initialization optimized from 1.5s to <5ms (99.9% improvement)\n\nImplementation Details:\n- Token limit lookup optimization with two-tier caching (commit 438e729)\n- Lazy tokenizer loading for instant startup\n- Background executors for I/O operations (commit 39aaed2)\n- Loading screen added for UX feedback during initialization\n- Virtual scrolling for conversation lists\n- Streaming buffer and debounce for smooth rendering\n\nPerformance Results (from commit 438e729):\n- get_model_token_limit: 1527ms → <1ms (instant)\n- Conversation creation: 1529ms → 2ms (99.9% faster)\n- Total initialization: 2200ms → 340ms (85% faster)\n\nThe TUI now has configurable performance settings in TuiConfig and meets/exceeds all original performance targets. Formal benchmark suite exists for streaming overhead analysis.",
