  "description": "Implement intelligent code search capabilities for Consoul inspired by Aider's RepoMap and other AI coding assistants.\n\n## Vision\nTransform Consoul from basic bash execution to a true coding assistant with semantic code understanding, enabling users to:\n- Search code by structure and semantics, not just text\n- Navigate codebases intelligently\n- Find symbol definitions and references\n- Understand code relationships\n\n## Approach\nThree-tier implementation:\n1. Fast text search (ripgrep-based) - Quick wins\n2. AST-based code search (Aider's RepoMap approach) - Core functionality  \n3. Optional LSP integration (Serena-style) - Advanced features\n\n## Success Criteria\n- Code search tools integrated into SDK\n- Performance comparable to Aider\n- Works with 20+ major languages\n- Zero-config for basic usage\n- Documented and tested\n\n## Dependencies\n- grep-ast library\n- tree-sitter parsers\n- ripgrep (optional, with fallback)\n\n## Reference\nBased on research from SOUL-91 comparing:\n- Aider (RepoMap with tree-sitter)\n- Serena (LSP-based)\n- cursor-agent (hybrid approach)\n- OpenCode (LSP integration)\n- wcgw (file-based)\n\n## Timeline\nEstimate: 3-4 weeks for full implementation\n- Week 1: Text search + infrastructure\n- Week 2: AST parsing + RepoMap\n- Week 3: Symbol search + references  \n- Week 4: Testing + documentation",
