  "title": "SDK Decoupling & Architecture Refactoring",
  "description": "Decouple business logic from TUI layer to enable SDK-first architecture. Extract ~3,000 lines of business logic from tui/app.py into reusable service layer. This is prerequisite work for EPIC-011 (WebSocket/FastAPI Backend Support). Enables: headless SDK usage, FastAPI/WebSocket servers, web UI development, independent testing of business logic, and eventual package separation (consoul-sdk, consoul-cli, consoul-tui).",
