  "title": "Split into Separate Packages",
  "description": "Long-term goal: Separate consoul-sdk, consoul-cli, consoul-tui into independent PyPI packages for modular distribution. Enables SDK-only installation without TUI/CLI overhead. Users can install only what they need: pip install consoul-sdk (minimal), pip install consoul-cli (SDK + CLI), pip install consoul-tui (SDK + TUI). Requires successful completion of EPIC-012 (Phases 1-4) first. This is optional/future work for better package distribution and dependency management.",
