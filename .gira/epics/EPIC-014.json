  "description": "Split into Separate Packages\n\n**STATUS: DEFERRED - Using Optional Extras Instead**\n\n## Decision\n\nAfter evaluating monorepo vs submodules for production server deployment (Dec 2025), decided to **keep monorepo with optional extras** instead of package splitting.\n\n## Rationale\n\n**Pros of Monorepo:**\n- ✅ Faster development velocity (change everything at once)\n- ✅ Simpler versioning (one package version)\n- ✅ Easier testing (test everything together)\n- ✅ Simple CI/CD (one pipeline)\n- ✅ Easier refactoring (no cross-package coordination)\n\n**Cons of Splitting:**\n- ❌ Complex version management (4 packages to sync)\n- ❌ Integration testing harder\n- ❌ Breaking changes across packages difficult\n- ❌ Not needed yet (no evidence server usage >> CLI/TUI)\n\n## Alternative: Optional Dependencies\n\nUsing pyproject.toml optional extras instead:\n\n```bash\n# Backend developers (minimal)\npip install consoul[server]  # ~60MB, FastAPI + SDK only\n\n# CLI users\npip install consoul[cli]  # ~80MB, Click + Rich only\n\n# TUI users  \npip install consoul[tui]  # ~150MB, Textual included\n\n# Full installation\npip install consoul[all]  # Everything\n```\n\n## When to Reconsider\n\nSplit into separate packages IF:\n1. Server usage >> CLI/TUI usage (different user bases)\n2. Version sync becomes painful\n3. Install size becomes real problem (not theoretical)\n4. Community requests it\n\n## Related Work\n\n- EPIC-016: Production SDK Hardening (security, compliance)\n- EPIC-017: Production Server Package (consoul.server module)\n- EPIC-018: Legal Industry Template (deployment)\n\nNew epics focus on production readiness within monorepo, not package splitting.\n\n**Tickets SOUL-260, 261, 262 closed as won't-do-now.**",
