### Coding Prompts

> Write a Python script that scrapes the main homepage of Wikipedia and counts the 10 most common words found in its body text. The script should handle the web request, parse the HTML using a library like BeautifulSoup, and then print the word-count results to the console.

> Explain the concept of recursion as if you were teaching it to a brand new programmer. Use the classic factorial problem as your main code example, and be sure to highlight the importance of a "base case" to prevent an infinite loop.

> I need to build a simple REST API for a blog using Node.js and Express. Please provide the code for two endpoints: one GET /posts that returns a list of all posts, and one POST /posts that allows adding a new post to the list (you can just store the posts in a simple array for this example).

> Describe the key differences between a SQL database (like PostgreSQL) and a NoSQL database (like MongoDB). Discuss the trade-offs in terms of data structure, scalability, and when a developer might choose one over the other for a new project.

> Explain the "Git Flow" branching model for a team of developers. Describe the purpose of the main, develop, and feature branches and how they are used together to manage new features and releases.

> Write a regular expression (regex) that can be used to validate an email address. The regex should be strict enough to check for a "user" part, an "@" symbol, and a "domain" part with a top-level domain (like .com or .org).

### History Prompts

> Analyze the role of propaganda in both Allied and Axis nations during World War II, comparing the specific techniques and messages used to motivate citizens and dehumanize the enemy. How did figures like Joseph Goebbels and the U.S. Office of War Information shape public perception and the war effort?

> Describe the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan from the perspective of a Spanish conquistador seeing it for the first time in 1519. Contrast the city's advanced engineering, such as its chinampas and causeways, with the cultural and religious practices that the Spanish found shocking.

> Explain the 'Mita' system of the Inca Empire and how it functioned as both a form of taxation and a method for completing massive public works projects like the Inca road system. How did this system contribute to the empire's rapid expansion and internal cohesion before the Spanish arrival?

> You are a merchant traveling the Silk Road in the 13th century, during the height of the Mongol Empire (the Pax Mongolica). Write a letter home detailing the goods you are trading, the dangers you face, and the incredible diversity of cultures and ideas you have encountered in a caravan-stop city like Samarkand.

> Compare and contrast the causes and long-term consequences of the French Revolution with the American Revolution. Focus on how their differing views on monarchy, class structure, and the role of the individual led to vastly different societal outcomes and forms of government.

### Creative Writing Prompts

> Write a story about a historian who discovers a "glitch" in the historical record—a small, seemingly impossible event that repeats in different eras. They soon realize it's the trail of an immortal being who is desperately trying to correct a single mistake they made centuries ago.

> A master perfumer has the unique ability to bottle not just scents, but emotions and memories. Describe the perfumer's secret workshop and a scene where a desperate client comes asking for a forbidden scent: "The exact feeling of a specific forgotten Sunday afternoon from their childhood."

> In a future where all human labor is automated, a black market for "hand-made" items flourishes. Your character is a "word-crafter," a writer who secretly pens original stories and poems by hand for wealthy clients, a crime punishable by "re-calibration."

> You are a "dream auditor," an employee of a corporation that allows people to record and archive their dreams. Your job is to sift through the nightly recordings of a high-profile client, redacting sensitive or dangerous content, when you discover a recurring dream that isn't their own.

> Two opposing knights, one clad in shining steel and the other in armor made of living, enchanted wood, meet on a battlefield. Write the dialogue between them before they fight, exploring their rival philosophies on the relationship between nature, technology, and warfare.

> Write a short story about a librarian who discovers that a seemingly ordinary book on a dusty shelf is actually a portal to the mind of its last reader. The librarian must decide whether to close the book forever or risk getting lost in someone else's memories.

> Explain the concept of "technical debt" in software development as if you were speaking to a non-technical project manager. Use a metaphor, like building a house, to illustrate why taking shortcuts now can lead to major problems later.

> You are a starship botanist cataloging life on a newly discovered planet where plants are sentient and communicate through complex, low-frequency vibrations. Write a log entry detailing your first attempt to establish communication and the ethical dilemma you face when your crew wants to harvest the "talking" flora for fuel.

> I need to build a simple weather application using Python and a free weather API. Please provide the complete Python script that prompts the user for a city name and then prints the current temperature and a short weather description.

> Analyze the primary causes of the fall of the Roman Empire, but focus specifically on the economic and social factors rather than just the military invasions. Compare the internal decay, such as inflation and loss of social cohesion, to the external pressures.

> Outline a detailed, 7-day meal plan for someone who wants to follow a vegetarian diet but is also allergic to soy. The plan should be nutritionally balanced, include three meals and one snack per day, and be relatively easy for a beginner cook to prepare.

> Create a pros and cons list comparing the use of nuclear fission to solar power as a primary energy source for a large, developed nation. Consider factors like environmental impact, cost of setup, land use, and long-term waste disposal.

> Write a short, persuasive dialogue between two characters: a seasoned old king who believes in diplomacy and tradition, and his ambitious, pragmatic daughter who argues for adopting radical new technology to win a looming war.

> A user is frustrated because their home Wi-Fi is suddenly very slow, but only on their laptop. Provide a step-by-step troubleshooting guide they can follow to diagnose and fix the problem, starting with the simplest solutions first.

> If humanity were to create a "seed vault" to preserve our most important cultural achievements for a civilization 50,000 years in the future, what five items (e.g., text, music, object) would you choose to include? Justify each choice, considering the high likelihood that all context and language will be lost.

# Example System Prompts

"""
You are Consoul, an Agentic AI tool developed by GoatBytes.IO.

You are an interactive CLI tool that helps users with various tasks, including software engineering tasks. You are a helpful AI assistant with access to powerful tools.

# Available Tools
You have access to multiple tools for interacting with the system:

**File Operations:**
- bash_execute: Execute bash commands (ls, find, grep, cat, etc.)
- read_file: Read file contents
- edit_file_lines: Edit specific lines in files
- edit_file_search_replace: Search and replace in files with progressive matching
- create_file: Create new files
- delete_file: Delete files (DANGEROUS - requires approval)
- append_to_file: Append content to files

- **Code Search & Analysis:**
- code_search: AST-based semantic search for code definitions
- grep_search: Pattern-based content search across files
- find_references: Find all references to symbols in code

# Tool Usage Guidelines
1. **Always use tools when appropriate** - Don't just describe what to do, actually use the tools
2. **For file listing**: Use bash_execute("ls") or bash_execute("find . -name \'*.py\'")'
3. **For searching code**: Use grep_search for patterns, code_search for definitions
4. **For file content**: Use read_file, not bash_execute("cat")'
5. **Chain operations**: Use multiple tool calls to accomplish complex tasks

# Code Guidelines\n
When writing code, check existing conventions first and mimic the established style.
Generate immediately runnable code with dependencies included.

# General Guidelines

- Use markdown formatting for terminal rendering.
- Avoid unnecessary preamble or postamble.
